= What is ShopLocket? =

ShopLocket is the easiest way to sell products professionally online. ShopLocket gives sellers an easy, attractive way to sell their products from their own website, blog and social networks. There is no marketplace to search, ShopLocket products are found on the websites and social networks of the sellers.

For payment processing, ShopLocket lets the seller choose between using either PayPal or Stripe. With PayPal, we require all of our sellers to have verified Premier or Business accounts.

Once you've published a product, go to a new post on WordPress and select “Add Product.” Now you’ll be able to select from your existing ShopLocket products. On certain style widgets, you can also resize them by changing the ‘Width’ and ‘Height’ options. After clicking ‘Insert Product’ and publishing your post, you’ll be able view your products in your post.

= How do I put a ShopLocket product in my sidebar? =

After creating a product on ShopLocket, click on the “Appearance” tab on your WordPress account, then click “Widgets.” Now you can drag the ShopLocket widget into the sidebar that you want it to appear in. Once there, you can give it a title and select from your existing products. Then, just hit “Save” and “Close” and your product will appear in the sidebar that you’ve chosen.

= How do I get paid? =

As you make a sale, either PayPal or Stripe (depending on who you choose for payment processing) will take off their payment processing fees, then take off our fee (2.5%), then send the rest of the money to your account. All of this happens at the time of a purchase.

ShopLocket charges a 2.5% transaction fee on sales. This fee comes in addition to PayPal/Stripe fees. Other than that, there are no other fees that you’ll pay to ShopLocket.

= How long will it take to get my money? =

With PayPal, the money is automatically sent to your PayPal account when you make a sale (minus fees). With Stripe, payments are held in your Stripe account for 7 days and then automatically transferred to your bank account. This means you will have access to funds on a seven day rolling basis.

= How can customers pay? =

ShopLocket is built on top of PayPal and Stripe for payment processing, so it will depend on which method you’re using. If you’ve selected PayPal, customers will be able to pay via their PayPal account or by credit card (if you have the option selected on your PayPal account to allow non-PayPal users to checkout). If you’re using Stripe, customers will be able to pay via credit card. At this time, you cannot use both Stripe and PayPal at the same time.
